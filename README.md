### Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a 21 year old software developer, currently working as a .NET Software Engineer.<br>
I love hosting and contributing to open-source software, getting my hands on the latest gadgets and learning new frameworks to work with.

Among my repositories you will mainly find an extensive amount of SourceMod plugins, and projects like [SPCode](https://github.com/SPCodeOrg) and [my portfolio/blog website](https://github.com/maxijabase/maxijabase.dev).
