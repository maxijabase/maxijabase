### Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a software developer, and I like messing around with all kinds of things, backend, frontend, databases, devops, desktop, SourceMod plugins, and more.<br>
I love hosting and contributing to open-source software, getting my hands on the latest gadgets and learning new frameworks to work with.

Among my repositories and organizations, you will mainly find an extensive amount of SourceMod plugins, websites, applications and projects. Be my guest!
