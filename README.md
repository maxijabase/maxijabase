### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I sometimes work on SourcePawn plugins and .NET programs, such as [SPCode](https://github.com/SPCodeOrg/SPCode). <br>
Among my current skillset, you can find:
- .NET (C#, VB.NET)
  - Desktop
  - ASP.NET Core APIs
  - Microservices
- SourceMod Development (SourcePawn)
- Angular (JavaScript, TypeScript)
- SQL (MySQL, SQLite, Firebird)
- Linux
- Docker
