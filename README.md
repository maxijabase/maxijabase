### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I sometimes work on SourcePawn plugins. <br>
Currently maintaining [SPCode](https://github.com/SPCodeOrg/SPCode), a SourcePawn IDE. <br>
Among my current skillset, you can find:
- .NET (C#, VB.NET)
  - Desktop
  - ASP.NET Core APIs
  - Microservices
- SourceMod Plugins Development (SourcePawn)
- Angular (JavaScript, TypeScript)
- SQL (MySQL, SQLite, Firebird)
- Linux
- Docker
