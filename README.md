### Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a software developer, currently working as a .NET Engineer.<br>
I love hosting and contributing to open-source software, getting my hands on the latest gadgets and learning new frameworks to work with.

Among my repositories (and my TF2 community's organization [Electric Servers](https://github.com/electricservers)) you will mainly find an extensive amount of SourceMod plugins, websites, applications and projects like [SPCode](https://github.com/SPCodeOrg) and [my portfolio/blog website](https://github.com/maxijabase/maxijabase.dev).
